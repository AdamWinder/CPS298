I'm Adam Winder. I've been attending Washtenaw for a few years now on the C++ degree path, also taking a number of cybersecurity courses. As such, most of my programming experience is in C++, but I'm ready and eager to learn something new for this class. When I'm not working, I enjoy gaming, puzzles, listening to music, and working on random art/programming projects. I look forward to working with everyone on this project, and I really hope that I can be a good team lead.
