My name is Tyler Neubecker. I am in the C++ programming degree path with Washtenaw Community College.
I have experience with multiple languages. My strongest points being web programming. (HTML, CSS, PHP, JavaScript[a little]).
I am a father of a 7 year old boy, with another boy on the way right now. My SO and I just sold on a house in June, a nice little fixer upper.
I am looking forward to learning more aobut JavaScript here in class for this program. 
I also want to say thanks a ton to my team for their understanding as well. When we were supposed to meet for the first time I came down with COVID again, and it kicked my butt.
